# Product Governance Automation Framework
End-to-end automated Product Governance Framework that transforms raw product requests into prioritized, actionable insights. It empowers product managers to make data-driven decisions and gives stakeholders transparent visibility into priorities, progress, and the product roadmap.  

  
## Business Problem  

  
## Tools and Skills  

• **Google Forms** – Standardized intake of product requests, eliminating ad-hoc emails and inconsistent inputs.  
  
• **Google Sheets** – Central database and single source of truth, reducing duplication and manual consolidation.  
  
• **Google Apps Script** – Automated updates, scoring, and request enrichment, preventing invalid or inconsistent data from entering the database.  
  
• **Google Looker Studio** – Dynamic dashboards providing actionable insights and visibility into priorities and progress.  


## Process and Framework Application  
  
The developed automation aims to standardize product evolution while ensuring transparency of decisions and delivered value. It supports the Product Management process across the following steps:  
  
• Request Intake  
Any member of the software organization — from sales teams in direct contact with customers to engineering teams with deep technical expertise — can submit a high-level description of an idea or business need via Google Forms. These inputs will be evaluated by the Product Management team.  
  
• Centralization  
All requests automatically populate Google Sheets, which serves as the single source of truth for Product Management analysis. This ensures that ideas are not lost in private notes or informal conversations and that all inputs are consistently captured within the framework.  
  
• Scoring & Prioritization  
Rules implemented in Google Apps Script automatically score, prioritize, and update requests based on predefined Product Management criteria. Validation logic and dialog boxes prevent users from entering invalid or inconsistent data, safeguarding data quality and ensuring reliable downstream analysis and visualization.  
  
• Visualization  
Google Looker Studio dashboards provide real-time visibility into priority ranking, roadmap alignment, and progress tracking. These insights support management decision-making and enable clear communication with internal and external stakeholders, including product roadmap discussions.  
  
• Decision Making  
Product Managers and stakeholders use the dashboards as a shared decision-support tool to align on priorities, roadmap commitments, and next steps.  
  
  
## Business Value
  
This is your impact statement. Quantify if possible. Examples:

Reduced manual request consolidation by X hours/week.

Increased roadmap alignment and stakeholder satisfaction.

Improved decision speed: requests now prioritized in <X days instead of weeks.

Scalable, repeatable framework now supporting all product teams.

If you have numbers, include them — even approximate ones.

Example:

“Automating product request intake and prioritization reduced manual consolidation by ~10 hours/week, improved stakeholder visibility, and accelerated roadmap decisions from weeks to days.”
