# Product Governance Automation Framework
End-to-end automated Product Governance Framework that transforms raw product requests into prioritized, actionable insights. It empowers product managers to make data-driven decisions and gives stakeholders transparent visibility into priorities, progress, and the product roadmap.  

  
## Business Problem  

  
## Tools and Skills  

.: **Google Forms** – Standardized intake of product requests, eliminating ad-hoc emails and inconsistent inputs.  
  
.: **Google Sheets** – Central database and single source of truth, reducing duplication and manual consolidation.  
  
.: **Google Apps Script** – Automated updates, scoring, and request enrichment, preventing invalid or inconsistent data from entering the database.  
  
.: **Google Looker Studio** – Dynamic dashboards providing actionable insights and visibility into priorities and progress.  


## Process and Framework Application  
  
.: **Request Intake:** Users submit via Google Forms.  
  
.: **Centralization:** Requests auto-populate Google Sheets.  
  
.: **Scoring & Prioritization:** Apps Script evaluates and scores requests based on defined criteria.  
  
.: **Visualization:** Looker Studio dashboards show priority ranking, roadmap alignment, and progress tracking.  
  
.: **Decision Making:** PMs and stakeholders use dashboards to align on roadmap and next steps.  
  
  
## Business Value
  
This is your impact statement. Quantify if possible. Examples:

Reduced manual request consolidation by X hours/week.

Increased roadmap alignment and stakeholder satisfaction.

Improved decision speed: requests now prioritized in <X days instead of weeks.

Scalable, repeatable framework now supporting all product teams.

If you have numbers, include them — even approximate ones.

Example:

“Automating product request intake and prioritization reduced manual consolidation by ~10 hours/week, improved stakeholder visibility, and accelerated roadmap decisions from weeks to days.”
