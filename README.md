# Product Governance Automation Framework

End-to-end automated Product Governance Framework that transforms raw product requests into prioritized, actionable insights. It empowers product managers to make data-driven decisions and gives stakeholders transparent visibility into priorities, progress, and the product roadmap.  

  
## Business Problem  

The absence of a defined Product Management process and governance structure resulted in limited visibility into the product’s potential, strategic direction, and value creation. Customer and internal requests were distributed across individual notebooks and informal channels, making it difficult to assess demand patterns, prioritize effectively, or maintain a coherent product strategy.  
  
Product decisions were largely centralized with a single director, without a transparent rationale or clear linkage to customer value, business impact, or roadmap objectives. As a result, prioritization was reactive, stakeholder alignment was weak, and valuable insights were frequently lost.  
  
A structured framework was required to bring clarity to the product architecture (modules), identify where demand was concentrated, and establish a consistent, data-driven approach to prioritization and strategic focus.  
  
  
## Tools and Skills  

• **Google Forms** – Standardized intake of product requests, eliminating ad-hoc emails and inconsistent inputs.  
  
• **Google Sheets** – Central database and single source of truth, reducing duplication and manual consolidation.  
  
• **Google Apps Script** – Automated updates, scoring, and request enrichment, preventing invalid or inconsistent data from entering the database.  
  
• **Google Looker Studio** – Dynamic dashboards providing actionable insights and visibility into priorities and progress.  


## Process and Framework Application  
  
The developed automation aims to standardize product evolution while ensuring transparency of decisions and delivered value. It supports the Product Management process across the following steps:  
  
• **Request Intake**  
Any member of the software organization — from sales teams in direct contact with customers to engineering teams with deep technical expertise — can submit a high-level description of an idea or business need via Google Forms. These inputs will be evaluated by the Product Management team.  
  
• **Centralization**  
All requests automatically populate Google Sheets, which serves as the single source of truth for Product Management analysis. This ensures that ideas are not lost in private notes or informal conversations and that all inputs are consistently captured within the framework.  
  
• **Scoring & Prioritization**  
Rules implemented in Google Apps Script automatically score, prioritize, and update requests based on predefined Product Management criteria. Validation logic and dialog boxes prevent users from entering invalid or inconsistent data, safeguarding data quality and ensuring reliable downstream analysis and visualization.  
  
• **Visualization**  
Google Looker Studio dashboards provide real-time visibility into priority ranking, roadmap alignment, and progress tracking. These insights support management decision-making and enable clear communication with internal and external stakeholders, including product roadmap discussions.  
  
• **Decision Making**  
Product Managers and stakeholders use the dashboards as a shared decision-support tool to align on priorities, roadmap commitments, and next steps.  
  
  
## Business Value
  
The **Product Governance Automation Framework** brings a positive impact in four dimensions:  
  
**1. Efficiency & Cost of Delay**  
• Less manual consolidation  
• Faster prioritization cycles  
• Better distribution of resources across modules to improve  
  
**2. Decision Quality**  
• Data-driven prioritization  
• Reduced bias and single-person dependency  
• Clear rationale behind decisions  
  
**3. Transparency & Alignment**  
• Stakeholders see why decisions are made  
• Fewer escalation meetings  
• Stronger trust in Product Management  
  
**4. Scalability & Governance**  
• Process works as demand grows  
• New products/modules can be added  
• Framework survives team changes
